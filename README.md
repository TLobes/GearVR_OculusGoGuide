# GearVR_OculusGoGuide
A current guide for quickly deploying Unity -> Samsung Gear VR || Oculus Go

I'm developing this guide as a way to keep track of how to get going with Gear VR or Oculus Go development, from getting Unity set up to deploying an app, including common issues that arise. The reason is that I always find it frusterating to get started again each time I beign a project as many of the available tutorials and docs are always obsolete or out of date.

This guide will aim to:

- Set up Unity and Android Studio
- Set up the OS and device
- Integrate the (current && working) Oculus SDK
- Deploy to an Android device using the Gear VR
- ~~Deploy to the Oculus Go~~ **Need to buy an Oculus Go D:**
- Develop an app in Unity that shows how to use the hardware's funcationality

I invite anyone to submit issues or make PRs to keep things correct and up to date for the community's benefit. I'm sure there will be a lot of things I have missed or could do better.
